# Splunk-project

## Data Source:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/data

## Objectives:
Security Monitoring: Detect and respond to potential security threats.
IT Operations: Monitor server performance, application logs, or network traffic to ensure uptime and performance.
Business Analytics: Analyze sales data, customer behavior, or website traffic to gain insights into your business.
DevOps Monitoring: Track CI/CD pipelines, application logs, or container metrics to optimize deployments.

## Install Splunk:

Use docker to open splunk

## Create Indexes:

Define multiple indexes based on your data types (e.g., web_logs, sys_logs, app_logs, sales_data).
Configure retention policies for different indexes to manage storage efficiently.

Ingest Data:

Use Splunk’s data inputs to ingest data. Upload files manually, set up directory monitors, or configure forwarders for live data.
Validate that data is being indexed correctly by running basic searches (e.g., index=web_logs | head 10).
Phase 3: Data Analysis and Searching
Field Extraction and Data Enrichment:

Extract fields from your logs using Splunk’s Field Extractor or by writing regex-based extractions.
Enrich your data with lookups, such as adding geolocation data based on IP addresses or mapping product IDs to product names.
Search and Query Building:

Start with basic searches (index=web_logs) and gradually build more complex queries:
Time-based searches: Analyze trends over time (e.g., timechart).
Stats and Aggregation: Use stats, eventstats, tstats for aggregating data.
Transforming Commands: Use commands like eval, rex, transaction to manipulate data.
Advanced Searching Techniques:

Implement subsearches, joins, and union operations to combine different datasets.
Use Splunk’s dedup and outlier functions to refine your searches.
Phase 4: Visualization and Dashboarding
Create Visualizations:

Build a variety of visualizations, such as time charts, bar charts, pie charts, and tables.
Use geo maps to display geographical data (e.g., web traffic by region).
Design Dashboards:

Create multiple dashboards:
Overview Dashboard: A high-level dashboard that gives an overview of key metrics.
Detailed Dashboard: Dashboards that drill down into specific areas, such as security incidents or sales trends.
Make use of dynamic drilldowns and input controls (dropdowns, date pickers) to allow for interactive exploration.
Phase 5: Alerting and Reporting
Set Up Alerts:

Create alerts for various conditions:
Threshold-based Alerts: Trigger an alert when a value exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., CPU usage > 90%).
Anomaly Detection: Set alerts for unusual patterns or spikes in activity.
Real-Time Alerts: For security incidents like multiple failed login attempts or unauthorized access.
Automate Reports:

Schedule regular reports that summarize key metrics or incidents.
Use PDF or CSV formats to share reports with stakeholders.
Phase 6: Integrations and Automation
Workflow Actions:

Create workflow actions that link search results to external systems (e.g., open a ticket in a ticketing system based on an alert).
Integrate with External Tools:

Integrate Splunk with tools like Slack or email to send notifications.
Use APIs to fetch or send data between Splunk and other platforms.
Leverage Machine Learning:

Use Splunk’s Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to build models for predictive analytics or anomaly detection.
Apply these models to your data to identify trends or potential issues before they become critical.
Phase 7: Documentation and Presentation
Document Your Process:

Document each phase of your project, including data sources, search queries, and visualizations.
Provide explanations for the decisions made during the project.
Prepare a Presentation:

Create a presentation that summarizes your findings and demonstrates the functionality of your Splunk dashboards and alerts.
Highlight how your project can provide value to the business or solve specific problems.
Review and Feedback:

Share your project with peers or mentors for feedback.
Make improvements based on the feedback to refine your skills and project outcomes.
