### Create reports

#### 1. Security Report: Failed Login Attempts

Purpose: Monitor failed login attempts to identify potential security threats, such as brute-force attacks.

index=security sourcetype=linux_secure action=failure
| stats count by user, src_ip
| sort -count

Schedule the Report:
In the report creation screen, select "Schedule".
Set the frequency (daily 10am).
Set up an email notification if the report identifies a high number of failures.

#### 2. Business Insight Report: Top Products or Services Accessed

Purpose: Identify which products or services are most frequently accessed, giving insight into user behavior and business trends.

index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| rex field=url "/(?<product>[^/]+)\?"
| stats count by product
| sort -count

Schedule the Report:
Schedule it to run weekly or monthly to track trends over time.
Consider setting up alerts if access to specific products increases or decreases significantly.

#### 3. Custom Report: Website Traffic Overview
Purpose: Monitor overall website traffic trends, helping you understand peak usage times and potential issues.

index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| timechart span=1h count by host

Schedule the Report:
Schedule it to run daily or every few hours.
Useful to understand traffic patterns and identify potential load or availability issues.

Frequency: Choose when and how often the report should run (e.g., daily at 6 AM).
Time Range: Define the time range the report should cover (e.g., "Last 24 hours").
Alert Actions: Choose if you want to send an email or trigger another alert when the report runs.
Review and Save: Finalize and save the scheduled report.

### Create 3 Alerts

#### Alert 1: Excessive Failed Login Attempts (Security Monitoring)
Purpose: Detect potential brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts by monitoring excessive failed login attempts within a short period.

index=security sourcetype=linux_secure action=failure
| stats count by src_ip
| where count > 10

Alert Configuration:
Trigger Condition: When count > 10 (indicating more than 10 failed login attempts from the same IP within a specific time).
Time Window: 10 minutes (adjust based on your environment).
Alert Actions: Send an email.

#### Alert 2: High Website Response Time (Performance Monitoring)
Purpose: Identify when your website's response time exceeds acceptable thresholds, which may indicate performance issues.

index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| stats avg(response_time) as avg_response_time by host
| where avg_response_time > 2  // Adjust threshold as needed

Alert Configuration:
Trigger Condition: When avg_response_time > 2 seconds.
Alert Actions: Send an email.

#### Alert 3: Unusual Spike in Traffic (Traffic Monitoring)
Purpose: Detect unusual spikes in website traffic that could indicate a DDoS attack or viral content.

index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| timechart span=5m count
| eventstats avg(count) as avg_traffic
| where count > 2 * avg_traffic

Alert Configuration:
Trigger Condition: When count > 2 * avg_traffic (indicating traffic has doubled compared to the average).
Time Window: 15 minutes.
Alert Actions: Send an email.

### Bonus 1. Use Macros

Process: setteing-advanced search

Name: failed_login_attempts

index=security sourcetype=linux_secure action=failure


#### 2. Use Field Aliases

Sourcetype, Source, or Host: Specify the sourcetype (like access_combined) that this alias applies to.
Original Field: Enter the original field name (e.g., client_ip).
Alias Field: Enter the new field name (e.g., src_ip).


index=your_index sourcetype=access_combined | stats count by src_ip
same as
index=your_index sourcetype=access_combined | stats count by client_ip


#### 3. Steps to Implement Drilldowns in Splunk:

Process: 

First, navigate to Dashboards from the Splunk homepage.
Choose an existing dashboard to edit.

Click Edit at the top right of the dashboard to enable edit mode.
Select the Visualization Panel:

Hover over the panel you want to add a drilldown to and click on the Edit icon (a pencil icon).
Set Up the Drilldown Action:

In the panel editing window, scroll down to find the Drilldown section.
By default, Splunk might have "Enable drilldown" checked. Here you can specify the drilldown behavior:
Link to Search: This option will take you to a search page pre-filtered by the clicked value.
Link to Dashboard: This allows you to link to another dashboard.
Link to Custom URL: If you want to open an external page.
